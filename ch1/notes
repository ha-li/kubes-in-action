=======================

To interact with Kubernetes, you will need kubectl cli client.
To install kubectl, run:
   > curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

   to see the components of your cluster:
   > kubectl cluster-info

   to see all the nodes in your cluster:
   > kubectl get nodes

   to describe a node
   > kubectl describe node <node-name>

   to run an docker image on kubernetes cluster (for a replication controller)
   > kubectl run kubia --image=haja/kubia --port=8080 --generator=run/v1

   to get all the pods
   > kubectl get pods

   to describe a pod
   > kubectl describe pod <pod-name>


kubernetes does not run individual containers, rather, it runs them inside pods. so containers can
be co-located in pods.
