This chapter is about configmap volumes and secret volumes

topics of review
-specifying arguments to pass config options to container using command line arguments 
-using env variables as a way to config container
-using configmap volumes

Overriding Docker default commands and arguments
-----------------------------------------------
In a Dockerfile, the two instructions in ENTRYPOINT and CMD serve very specific purpose:
 ENTRYPOINT - defines the executabble invoked when the container is started
 CMD - the arguments to pass to ENTRYPOINT

although you can use CMD to specify the full command and argument to execute, the 
correct way is through ENTRYPOINT, and only specify CMD if you want to define the
default arguments.

Then the image can be run without any arguments: 
 > docker run <image>   ( this will trigger ENTRYPOINT )

To specify arguments:
 > docker run <image> <arguments>  (this will pass <arguments> as CMD to ENTRYPOINT)

ENTRYPOINT supports two forms:
-  shell form ENTRYPOINT node app.js
-  exec form ENTRYPOINT ["node", "app.js"]


to build haja/fortune:args:
 docker build -t docker.io/haja/fortune:args .
to push it to docker hubb
 docker push docker.io/haja/fortune:args

to run the image locally:
 docker run -it docker.io/haja/fortune:args


To see the contents of the file generated on the docker image:
 docker exec <container_id> more /etc/htdocs/index.html

you should see a new file generated every 10 secs (from ch6) and x secs from this chapter 


If you are building a kubernetes pod, you can choose to override the container ENTRYPOINT and
CMD. To do that, in the spec:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: some/image
    command: ["/bin/command"]
    args: ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
...

-most of the time you will only set the args and rarely will you override the command.
-once the command and args are set, they cannot be updated after the pod is created


So using the above, we can create a pod spec that overrides a CMD argument:

> vi fortune-override-args.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fortune-override
spec:
  containers:
  - image: haja/fortune:args
    args: ["2"]                    <---- this is an override of content from ch6
    name: html-generator
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /var/htdocs
  - image: nginx:alpine
    name: web-server
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      readOnly: true
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  volumes:
  - name: html
    emptyDir: {}

the changes above means 2 is the arg to fortune:args, which means the loop runs every 2 secs
and generates a new /var/htdocs/index.html every 2 secs, vs in ch6, it was always 10 secs

In this example, there was only 1 argument to pass. If you have multiple arguments, you can use
the list notation:

...
spec:
  containers:
  - image: haja/fortune:args
    args: 
    - foo
    - bar
    - "15"
    name: html-generator
...

to see the kubernetes pod spec for overriding default arguments see contents of fortune-args

Specifying Environment Variables in a Container Definition
----------------------------------------------------------
you can pass environment variables to a container in the pod spec:
-there is not an option to define a pod env variable and have all containers in the pod inherit it
-the environment variable is defined at the container level using the pod spec.
-if you want each container to have the same value, you need to specify in each container

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: fortune-env
spec:
  containers:
  - image: haja/fortune:env
    env:
    - name: INTERVAL
      value: "30"
    name: html-generator
...

see contents of fortune-env for the kubernetes pod spec and the docker container.


If you need to reuse the value of a previously set env variable:

    env:
    - name: FIRST_VAR
      value: "foo"
    - name: SECOND_VAR
      value: "$(FIRST_VAR)bar"


Drawbacks of harding coding environment variables
-------------------------------------------------
Hard coding environment variables in a pod spec means to need separate pod spec for your
production and development pods. You want to reuse the same pod spec, but have different
configuration values in different environments.

This is where ConfigMap resources comes into play.



Using ConfigMap to Decouple Configuration
-----------------------------------------
You want to be able to decouple config options that varying in different environments separate
from the source code. Your pod descriptor is really source code for your application, so
you want really want the configurations outside of your pod description.

ConfigMaps
----------
ConfigMaps are objects that hold key/value pairs. The values can be short literals
to full config files

Applications doesn't need to read the config map directly, or even know that it exists.
The contents of the config map are passed to containers either as environment variables or
as files in a volume.
- if the content is referenced as a command line arg, then you can use the notation $(ENV_VAR)
  like done in the args example above
-if the content of the config map is referenced as a file in a volume, then you can treat it as
 so (below)

Having the config in a separate stand-alone obbject like this allows you to keep multiple
manifests for configMaps with the same name. Pods reference the configMap by name.


Creating a ConfigMap
--------------------
There are two ways to create a config map
 - kubectl create configmap with simple values
 - kubectl create configmap from files stored in disk
       1) with yaml descriptors
       2) with conf files
       3)

 both are created using: 
     kubectl create configmap ...

Simple Values
-------------
the simplest way to create a configmap is by using the kubectl create command:

 > kubectl create configmap fortune-config-literal --from-literal=sleep-interval=25

   this will create a config map called fortune-config that will hold one value:
      sleep-interval : 25

   to see this config map, 
 > kubectl get configmap fortune-config-literal -o yaml
    and you wil get back its yaml descriptor

 apiVersion: v1
 data: 
    sleep-interval: "25"
 kind: ConfigMap
 metadata:
     creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T19:56:59Z
     name: simple-config-literal
     namespace: default
     resourceVersion: "84354"
     selfLInk: /api/v1/namespace/default/configmaps/fortune-config
     uid: 6370a19c-176d-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7
 

 You can also create multiple literals at the same time under one config map

 > kubectl create configmap multi-config-literal --from-literal=foo=bar --from-literal=bar=bax --from-literal=one=two
   this will create a config map called simple-config with 3 values:
      foo : bar
      bar : bax
      one : two

 you can see the yaml descriptors for these two config maps using kubectl get configmap:

 > kubectl get configmap multi-config-literal -o yaml

 apiVersion: v1
 data:
   bar: baz
   foo: bar
   one: two
 kind: ConfigMap
 metadata:
   creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T19:58:47Z
   name: multi-config-literal
   namespace: default
   resourceVersion: "576007"
   selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/myconfigmap
   uid: a380b3fe-176d-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7

 
   
 You can also create configmaps using the kubectl create command with a yaml descriptor file
 > kubectl create -f fortune2-config.yaml
   
   (the only data required in the metadata section is name:)
apiVersion: v1
data:
   ninja: haja
   orange: new-black
   grey: rain
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
   name: fortune2-config


 Then to see the config map content:
 > kubectl get configmap fortune2-config -o yaml

-----------------

 To create config maps with config files:

 > kubectl create configmap test-config --from-file=test.conf

 kubernetes will look for test.conf in the current directory, and store the contents of
 test.conf in a config map with the file name as the map key (or you can specify a
 key manually)

 To see the contents of this config map:

 > kubectl get configmap test-config -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  test.conf: |+
    hi: bye
    no: yes

kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T20:19:34Z
  name: test-config
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "577556"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/test-config
  uid: 8aab002d-1770-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7


 To create config map from json file:
-------------------------------------
 > kubectl create configmap test-json-config --from-file=test-json.json
 
 kubernetes will look for test-json.json from the current directory, and store the contents
 of test-json.json into a config map with the file name as the map key

 To see the contents of this config map

 > kubectl get configmap test-json-config -o yaml
 apiVersion: v1
data:
  test-json.json: |
    {
       day: "1"
       fun: 2
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T20:22:41Z
  name: test-json-config
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "577790"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/test-json-config
  uid: fa2018ca-1770-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7


Adding a custom key
-------------------
 > kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=customekey=my.json

 > kubectl get configmap my-config -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  customkey: |
    {
      a: b
      c: d
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T21:38:04Z
  name: my-config
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "578958"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/my-config
  uid: 81f7c280-177b-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7


Using path directory as source of configs
-----------------------------------------
To create a confim map with individual map entry for all files in a specific directory, use
the --from-file=/path/to/dir

> kubectl create configmap all-config --from-file=.

 this will create config maps of all the files in the current directory with the file names
 as the map keys (any files that are valid subdomain names -- including swp files, etc).

> kubectl get configmap all-config -o yaml 
  will show all the config maps from all the files in .

Combining options
-----------------
You can combine the various options into one command

> kubectl create configmap all-my-config 
  1  --from-file=foo.json
  2  --from-file=bar=foobar.conf
  3  --from-file=/config-opts/
  4  --from-literal=some=thing

 1 - is single file config with the file name as map name
 2 - is single file with specified map name
 3 - is from whole directory
 4 - is a literal value

eg:
> kubectl create configmap uni-config --from-file=test.conf --from-file=unikey=test.conf --from-literal=test=dee

> kubectl get configmap all-my-config -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  test: dee
  test.conf: |+
    hi: bye
    no: yes

  unikey: |+
    hi: bye
    no: yes

kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T22:10:51Z
  name: uni-config
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "580237"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/uni-config
  uid: 16e31d99-1780-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7



Using the values from a config map
----------------------------------
To use the values from the map in your pod container, in your yaml descriptor:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: fortune-config
spec:
   containers:
   - image: haja/fortune:env
     env:
     - name: INTERVAL
       valueFrom:
         configMapKeyRef:
           name: fortune-config
           key: sleep-interval
...

This will set the environment variable INTERVAL with a value from the config map fortune-config 
with key "sleep-interval"


If the container using the config map is created and the config map is not yet started, when the pod
is created, the container will not start (other containers not referencing the config map will jstart just 
fine, but the container with the broken config map reference will not start).
If you then create the missing config map, the failed container will start not requiring the pod be 
recreated.

Optionally, you can set configMapKeyRef.optional: true, in which case, the container will
still start even if the config map does not exist

ConfigMaps are an excellent way of decoupling the configuration from the pod specification, allowing
you to keep all the configuration options close together instead of having them
splattered around the pod definition or duplicated across multiple pod manifests.

If the environment variable is an invalid name, kubernetes will skip the conversion.
So if the environment variable name is CONFIG_FOO-BAR, this will not work.

Exposing all the environment variables using the envFrom option:
----------------------------------------------------------------
You can expose all keys as environment variabels using the envFrom attribute.

...
spec:
  containers:
  - image: some-image
    envFrom:
    - prefix: CONFIG_
      configMapRef:
         name: my-config-map

This spec will expose all the values from my-config-map as environment variables, prefixed with: CONFIG_
The prefix is optional, if it is not specfied, it will just export the keys from the configMap with no
prefix.

Passing a configMap entry as a command line argument
----------------------------------------------------
To pass the value from a configMap as an argument to the main process running in the container:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: fortune-args-from-configmap
spec:
  containers:
  - image: haja/fortune:args
    env:
    - name: INTERVAL
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: fortune-config
          key: sleep-interval
    args: ["$(INTERVAL)"]

env: -name: INTERVAL will define an environment variable INTERVAL
args: ["$(INTERVAL)"] will use the defiend env variable as argument to the container process


ConfigMap volume to expose ConfigMap entries as files
-----------------------------------------------------
ConfigMap can also contain whole config files.
You can then expose those to the container using a special volume, a configMap volume.

-configMap volume will expose each entry of the configMap as a file, the process running
in the container can obtain the entry's value by reading the contents of the file

-this is the ideal way to pass large config files to the container

first create a directory nginx-conf for holding all your config files, 
in nginx-conf will be 2 files, my-nginx-config.conf and sleep-interval

 my-nginx-config.conf will be:

server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  www.kubia-example.com;

  gzip on;
  gzip_types text/plain application/xml;

  location / {
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index  index.html index.htm;
  }
}

sleep-interval will be:

25

create a config map called fortune-config from this directory

> kubectl create configmap fortune-config --from-file=nginx-conf
configmap/fortune-config created

To see the contents of this configmap:
> kubectl get configmap fortune-config -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  my-nginx-config.conf: "server {\n  listen       80;\n  server_name  www.kubia-example.com;\n\n
    \ gzip on;\n  gzip_types text/plain application/xml; \n \n  location / {\n    root
    \  /usr/share/nginx/html;\n    index  index.html index.htm;\n  }\n}\n"
  sleep-interval: |
    25
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-01-13T23:01:29Z
  name: fortune-config
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "584004"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/fortune-config
  uid: 2975392f-1787-11e9-9d69-080027551fc7
 

To create a volume populated with teh contents of a ConfigMap:
-create a volume that references the configMap by name, 
-mount the volume in a container
-initialize the volume with files created from a configMap entry


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fortune-configmap-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: web-server
    volumeMounts:
    ...
    - name: config              <------ 1
      mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
      readOnly: true
    ...
  volumes:
  ...
  - name: config                <-------2
    configMap:                  <-------2
      name: fortune-config      <-------2
  ...

This spec 2) defines a volume named config that is a configMap named fortune-config
and 1) references 2), mounting it at mountPath /etc/nginx/conf.d so that nginx automatically uses it

After running the container, if you look in /etc/ngxin/conf.d you should see
my-nginx-config.conf
sleep-interval

Since you don't really want sleep-interval as a file, and you are going to pass it in as a 
env variable, you really want to populate a configMap volume with only part of the configMap's
entries:

  ...
  volumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: fortune-config
      items:                            <-----1
      - key: my-nginx-config.conf       <-----2
        path: gzip.conf                 <-----3

1 using items: will select the entries to include in the volume
2 selects the entry specified bby key
3 the name of the file you want it to be saved as (gzip.conf)

Mounting a volume as a directory will hid any files in the original /etc/nginx/conf.d
which is okay if that is what you want, but you can also just mount a file into a directory

...
spec:
  containers:
  - image: some/image
    volumeMounts: 
    - name: myvolume
      mountPath: /etc/someconfig.conf   <-----1
      subPath: myconfig.conf            <-----2

1 This specifies you are mounting a file
2 you are only mounting the myconfig.conf entry (part of the volume)

By default, all files in a configMap volume are 644 (-rw-r-r--).
To change that:

...
volumes:
- name: config
  configMap:
    name: fortune-config
    defaultMode: "6600"    <-----1

1 will change the files to -rw-rw----


Updating App config without restarting
--------------------------------------
when you use an environment variable or command line arg, you have to restart the container
to pick up changes

configmap changes exposed as a volume allows you to update the config without having to 
recreate the pod or even restart the container
-when you update a configmap, all the files in the volume referencing it are updated,
 the process then needs to detect they've been changed and reload them


Secrets
--------
secrets are like config maps except that they hold secret information
-secrets can be passed to the container as environment variable or 
- expose secret entries as files in a volume

secrets are only distributed to nodes that runt he pods that need access to the Secret volume
-secrets are stored in memory, preventing the need to wipe the disk after
