to build this docker image:

to push this docker image to docker hub
 docker push docker.io/<id>fortune:env

to run this docker image
 docker run -it docker.io/<id>/fortune:env
 but since INTERVAL is not defined, you will see an error.
 the only way is to run this as a kubectl defined with a spec that defines INTERVAL as an environment variable
 

 this is what the pod spec ../fortune-env.yaml is for
  kubectl create -f fortune-env.yaml

 set up port-forwarding:
  kubectl port-forward fortune-env 8080:80

 the pod spec creates a env variable for 30 secs that is passed into the docker container

 to see the effects, either point your browser to localhost:8080
 or curl http://localhost:8080
