to get the full yaml description of a pod
 > kubectl get pod -o yaml

to outline the pod spec
 > kubectl explain pods

for specifics of the spec
 > kubectl explain pod.spec

to create a pod from a yaml spec
 > kubectl create -f <file spec>
 > kubectl create -f kubia-manual.yaml

to get the full description after creation
 > kubectl get pod <pod name> -o yaml/json

to get the logs of kubernetes pod
 > kubectl logs <pod-name>
   kubectl logs kubia-manual

  logs are rotated daily and when they reach 10 MB. kubectl logs only show current log file.
if you pod container multiple containers, you have to specify the container name
 > kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container>
   kubectl logs kubia-manual -c kubia

port forwarding
 > kubectl port-forward <pod-name> port1:port2
   will forward port1 of your machine to port2 of your pod
   to now in a new terminal, use curl localhost:port1 to hit the pods port2


Labels

-a key value pair attachable to resources that can then be used to select resources
 using label selectors; kinda like tags in aws
-a resource can have more than one label as long as the keys of the labels are unique 
 within that resource
-usually attach a label to a resource when you create them, but labels can be
 added/modified even after the resource has been created, without the need to 
 recreate the resource.

 aside - a canary release is when you deploy a new version of an application next to the
 stable version, and only let a small fraction of users hit the canary version to see
 how it behaves before rolling it out to all users, preventing a large exposure if
 the release is unstable

-labels will be visible to all person with access to that cluster
 > kubectl get pods --show-labels

-can also specify the labels you are interested in, and all pods will be returned with
 labels in speciial columns
 > kubectl get pods -L creation_method,env

-you can also modify the labels of existing pods
 > kubectl label pod kubia-manual creation_method=manual
   this will modify the creation_method label of kubia-manual to be manual

-if the pod already has that label, then you have to specify to overwrite it
 > kubectl label pod kubia-manual-v2 env=debug --overwrite
